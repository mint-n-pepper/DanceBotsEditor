# Build & Deployment Instructions
## Windows
### Build
1. Install ```cmake``` from https://cmake.org/download/.
2. Install Visual Studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/.
3. Install Qt 5.12.6 LTS from https://www.qt.io/. You only have to select/install the MSVC 2015 64-bit version.
4. Create the environment variable ```CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``` and set it to the directory where the Qt MSVC 2015 64-bit version is, e.g. ```C:\Qt\5.12.6\msvc2015_64```.
5. Clone the repository, best using the ```--recursive``` option to init and download all submodules.
6. Create build folder and run ```cmake``` in it, pointing to repo root, where root ```CMakeLists.txt``` is.
7. Compile in Visual Studio in Release. To avoid console from popping up upon startup add ```WIN32``` to the executable command in the Gui CMAKE code:
	```cmake
	add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} WIN32 ${SOURCES} ${APP_RESOURCES} ${HEADERS} ${QMLS})
	```
### Deploy
1. Copy the exe file to a deployment folder
2. Run the Qt deployment tool on the executable, pointing it to the QML folder and adding some extra flags (--compiler-runtime does not seem to work, though, as users still have to install the executable):
	```
	windeployqt.exe C:\Users\philipp\Git\dancebots_gui\build\gui\Release\dancebotsGui.exe --release --qmldir C:\Users\philipp\Git\dancebots_gui\gui\  --compiler-runtime --no-translations
	```
	This adds all necessary dlls to the deployment folder.

## macOS
### Prequisites
1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/):
   ```
   xcode-select--install
   ```
   If that fails, follow the instructions [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/macxcodecommandlinetools.html).

2. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.15 or above. The easiest is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
   ```
   brew install cmake
   ```

3. Install Qt 5.12.6 LTS. The easiest is to use the [online installer](https://www.qt.io/download). Take of the installation directory as you will need it later on.

4. Clone the repository and update submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

### Build
1. Navigate to the `dancebots_gui` directory and create a `build` directory:
   ```
   cd dancebots_gui/
   mkdir build
   ```

2. Navigate to the `build` directory, configure for release, and build the project:
   ```
   cd build/
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/5.12.6/clang_64/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
   make -j dancebotsEditor
   ```

### Deploy
1. Go to the subfolder ```gui/mac_os_rc```, and run the script ```deploy.sh ../../build```, where the first command line argument is the path to your build folder. The script then creates the folder ```DancebotsEditor.app``` in your build folder and copies the executable, icon, and run settings files to the appropriate subfolders.
2. Run the Qt deployment tool on the app folder to copy the appropriate frameworks to the app:
	```
		~/Qt/5.12.6/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt ./dancebotsEditor.app -qmldir=/Users/philipp/Git/dancebots_gui/gui -dmg
	```
	where the ```-dmg``` option creates an app dmg file. You should replace the Qt install folder and gui folders with the appropriate locations.


## Ubuntu 
### Prerequisites
1. Install build dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libpulse-dev libgl1-mesa-dev 
   ```

2. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.15 or above. The easiest is to use the package manager:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install cmake
   ```

3. Install Qt 5.12.6 LTS (gcc 64-bit). The easiest is to use the [online installer](https://www.qt.io/download). Take of the installation directory as you will need it later on.

3. Clone the repository and update submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

### Build
1. Navigate to the `dancebots_gui` directory and create a `build` directory:
   ```
   cd dancebots_gui/
   mkdir build
   ```

2. Navigate to the `build` directory, configure for release, and build the project:
   ```
   cd build/
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/5.12.6/gcc_64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
   make -j dancebotsEditor
   ```

   The `dancebotsEditor` binary will be located in `/path/to/dancebots_gui/build/gui/`.
